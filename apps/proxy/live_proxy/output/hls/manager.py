"""
HLS Output Manager

Reads from the shared TS Redis buffer, splits the stream into
keyframe-aligned TS segments (pure packet copy, no remux, no subprocess;
see segmenter.py), stores one segment per Redis chunk via the shared
format-parameterized output buffer, and maintains a rolling live playlist
descriptor in Redis that the playlist view renders per request.

One instance per channel per cluster - coordinated via the shared
output:{fmt}:owner lock, exactly like the fMP4 remux manager.

# target of 4 but a 4.5s one is not.
#
# Not 0.49, even though that is where rounding actually flips. A cut lands on
# the first picture at or past the ceiling, so the emitted EXTINF overshoots
# it by up to one frame interval, and a ceiling of 4.49 emitted a 4.538s
# segment against a target of 4 - which rounds to 5 and contradicts the
# frozen value. The margin leaves room for that overshoot on low frame rates.
#
# Why this is as tight as it is: TARGETDURATION is not merely a ceiling, it
# is the client's playlist reload interval (RFC 8216 6.3.4). Advertising
# more than one segment's worth makes the player reload more slowly than
# segments are produced, so it loses buffer lead every cycle. Measured with
# AVPlayer against 4s segments advertised as 6: the lead eroded from 7s to
# 1s in twelve seconds and playback stalled with four seconds of media
# sitting unfetched on the server. Advertising the cut target itself keeps
# reload cadence and production cadence equal.
